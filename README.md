Description:

The Semi-Automatic Traffic Light System, implemented in C++, offers a simulated solution for managing traffic lights in an intersection. The system leverages Object-Oriented Programming principles to encapsulate traffic light control logic within a single class, with separate functions for RED, YELLOW, and GREEN light phases. Key features include customizable light durations, user interaction prompting for loop continuation, and robust error handling for graceful program operation.

Simulation of Traffic Lights: Systematically simulates RED, YELLOW, and GREEN phases.

User Interaction: After each cycle, prompts the user to continue or stop the loop.

Customizable Light Durations: Adjustable durations for each light phase according to user preferences.

Error Handling: Ensures smooth program operation with validation for user input and graceful error handling.

Future Enhancements: Potential improvements may involve multi-intersection support, real-time synchronization, and integration of graphical interfaces for enhanced user experience.

Conclusion: The Semi-Automatic Traffic Light System exemplifies the practical application of OOP principles, providing an efficient and user-friendly solution for traffic light management simulations.
